# Emotion Model (Why Feelings Matter)

- **Check‑ins** capture a quick emotion/sensation with simple labels.  
- We visualize emotions over time (e.g., a calendar heatmap) to reveal patterns.  
- Emotions guide **pacing** and **focus**, but we avoid over‑personalization that feels invasive.  
- Language is non‑judgmental: support recovery, celebrate small returns.

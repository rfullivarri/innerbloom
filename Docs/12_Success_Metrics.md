# Success Metrics (Human‑Centered, Conceptual)

- **Activation**: first task completed within Day 1.  
- **Consistency**: % of days with ≥1 task done; weekly mission adherence.  
- **Balance**: distribution across Body/Mind/Soul over time.  
- **Recovery**: return rate after a missed day/week.  
- **Emotional Health**: self‑reported stability or uplift over weeks.  
- **Delight**: qualitative feedback on feeling supported, not judged.

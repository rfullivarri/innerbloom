# World & Narrative

**Theme:** You are cultivating your Inner Garden. Growth is steady, seasonal, and personal.

- **Metaphors**: seeds → sprouts → branches → canopy; roots as habits; light as attention.
- **Tone**: warm, respectful, lightly playful—never preachy.
- **Rituals**: weekly “tend your garden” moments; seasonal reflections.
- **Identity Shift**: rewards and titles reflect *how* you show up, not just outcomes.

# Core Game Mechanics (Conceptual)

## World Model
**Hierarchy:** Pillar → Trait → Stat → Task → Difficulty

- **Pillar**: Body / Mind / Soul (the three arenas of growth)
- **Trait**: The capability inside a pillar (e.g., Focus, Endurance, Compassion)
- **Stat**: What we measure for that trait (e.g., minutes of deep work, steps, gratitude entries)
- **Task**: The atomic action the player completes today
- **Difficulty**: Relative effort; informs pacing and XP

## Progress Systems
- **XP & Level**: Visible progress toward the next milestone.
- **Streaks**: Daily and weekly consistency indicators.
- **Missions → Skills**: Time‑boxed task bundles that *develop a skill*.
- **Rewards**: Symbolic unlocks aligned to consistency, not perfection.

## Balance Mechanic
Every plan includes balancing tasks across pillars, preventing single‑pillar overdrive.

# Design Principles (Non‑Negotiable)

1. **Small Steps, Big Momentum**  
   Always reduce to the next doable action. Completion beats perfection.

2. **Emotion‑Aware, Not Emotion‑Led**  
   We listen to feelings but ground decisions in sustainable routines.

3. **Balance by Design**  
   Every plan intentionally spans **Body, Mind, Soul** to avoid over‑optimization.

4. **Respect the User's Pace**  
   Modes adapt intensity. The product follows the person—not the other way around.

5. **Clarity, Then Delight**  
   Make choices obvious. Reward with meaningful feedback (XP, progress, rituals).

6. **Progress You Can See**  
   Visualize trends, streaks, and milestones—no hidden progress.

7. **Gentle Defaults, Honest Metrics**  
   Encourage consistency; never shame. Celebrate recovery after drops.

8. **Privacy Is a Feature**  
   We collect the minimum, explain the why, and give control back.

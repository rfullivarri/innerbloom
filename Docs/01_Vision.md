# Vision

**Innerbloom** is a gamified self‑improvement journey that converts intention into consistent action. We make the *next small step* obvious, rewarding, and emotionally sustainable.

## Problem We Solve
Self‑improvement breaks on friction: unclear priorities, fragile motivation, and lack of feedback. People need a system that meets them where they are and rewards steady, meaningful progress.

## Our Promise
- Translate goals into *daily, actionable tasks*.
- Make progress *visible* (XP, levels, streaks) and *felt* (emotion tracking).
- Balance ambition with care across **Body**, **Mind**, and **Soul**.

## North Star
> “Help people complete small actions *today* that compound into identity‑level change.”

## Product Truths
- Progress is more about **consistency** than intensity.
- Emotion is first‑class data.
- Personalization should feel like *support*, not surveillance.
